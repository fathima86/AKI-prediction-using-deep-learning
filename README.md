Deep Learning model for AKI Prediction on MIMIC-IV
Aki-Predictor is a set of python script running deep learning model to predict Acute Kiden Injuries during the first 7 days of stay in ICU. The proposed model was tested on MIMIC-IV database.

We developed our model based on 74 features referring to routinely collected clinical parameters.
The features includes demographics data, vital signs measured at the bedsidesuch as heart rate, arterial blood pressure, respiration rate, etc. laboratory test results such as blood urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, white blood count, etc. average of urine output, theminimum value of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and creatinine. We also included co-morbidities such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, etc.
